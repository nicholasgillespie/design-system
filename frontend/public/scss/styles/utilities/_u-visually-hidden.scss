/// The .u-visually-hidden class applies styles to an element that remove it from the visual flow of the document, but keep it accessible to assistive technologies. It uses a combination of clipping and positioning techniques to achieve this effect.

.u-visually-hidden:not(:focus):not(:active) {
  inline-size: 1px;
  block-size: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  clip-path: inset(50%);
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
}
