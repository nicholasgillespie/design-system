/// STYLES INDEX
///
/// This file acts as a central point for importing all SCSS styles used in the project.
/// It brings together global styles, compositions, utilities, blocks, and vendor-specific styles.
/// Each category is organized in its own directory, enhancing the project's maintainability.
///
/// The following imports are included:
/// - Global: Styles that are universally applied throughout the project.
/// - Compositions: Styles that define common layout patterns.
/// - Utilities: Helper styles that address frequent CSS patterns.
/// - Pages: Styles specific to different pages of the application.
/// - Blocks: Styles dedicated to specific components or "blocks".
/// - Vendor: Styles that are specific to third-party libraries or external code.
